floppyinject vdsm hook
======================
Hook create a floppy disk on the fly with user provided content.
ie. user supply file name and file content and hooks will create
floppy disk on destination host, will mount it as floppy disk - 
and will handle migration.
giving the input "myfile.vfd=data" will create a floppy with single
file name myfile.vfd and the file content will be "data"

syntax:
floppyinject=myfile.txt:<file content>

libvirt:
<disk type='file' device='floppy'>
    <source file='/tmp/my.vfd'/>
    <target dev='fda' />
</disk>

Note:
    some linux distro need to load the floppy disk kernel module:
    # modprobe floppy
